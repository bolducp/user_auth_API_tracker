# API Multi-City Weather Tracker with User Authentication 

## Note:
Currently, the app will only accept 5-digit zipcodes. If a user enters an invalid zipcode, everything breaks due to the way I'm accessing the API via the node request module. My next step will be fixing this bug.

## functionality
##### an app in which users can create and log into accounts and save many locations for tracking the weather
current functionality supports: viewing, adding, and deleting weather locations from one's profile, login and logout, account creation
